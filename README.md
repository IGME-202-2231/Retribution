### Game Description

In this top-down shoot'em up, you play as Lilith, a simple demon looking for her next meal. Unfortunately for you, the men of the cloth aren't too keen on being fed upon.
Claw your way through the house of God to ensure this supper isn't your last, growing stronger with each passing minute.
